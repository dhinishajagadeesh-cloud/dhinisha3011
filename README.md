Smart SheShield Tracker
A Women-Centric Smart Bus Arrival Alert System Using LDR Sensor
1. Abstract
Smart SheShield Tracker is a safety-focused bus arrival alert system designed to enhance passenger security and reduce waiting times, particularly for women in rural areas. The system uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor to detect the presence of an approaching bus and triggers audio alerts via a speaker. A battery backup ensuresuninterrupted operation. This low-cost, efficient, and easy-to-deploy system improves transportation awareness while minimizing safety risks caused by uncertain bus timings.
2. Introduction
Rural bus stops often lack real-time monitoring systems. Women and students face long waiting times without knowing the exact bus arrival, which leads to:
Wasted time
Safety concerns
Stress and inconvenience
Smart SheShield Tracker provides a simple technological solution using LDR sensors, a microcontroller, speaker alerts, and battery backup to notify passengers in advance.
3. Problem Statement
Current rural bus monitoring faces these issues:
No real-time bus arrival information
Long waiting periods at bus stops
Safety risks in isolated areas
Lack of automated alerts
Manual and inefficient monitoring
4. Why Solve This Problem
Addressing these issues will:
Improve passenger safety, especially for women
Reduce waiting time
Enhance transportation efficiency
Reduce uncertainty and stress
Introduce automation in rural transportation
5. Proposed Solution
The Smart SheShield Tracker system includes:
Bus-side LDR Sensor: Detects incoming buses using light variation.
Microcontroller: Processes the sensor input.
Speaker: Produces audible alerts when a bus is near.
Battery Backup: Ensures continuous system operation.
Workflow:
When the bus enters a predefined detection range, the LDR sensor triggers the microcontroller to activate the speaker alert. Passengers are immediately notified of the bus arrival.
6. System Architecture
Component	Function
Input	LDR Sensor detects approaching bus
Processing	Microcontroller interprets signals
Output	Speaker produces audio alert
Power	Battery backup ensures uninterrupted operation
7. Hardware Components
7.1 LDR Sensor
Detects bus proximity by sensing changes in light intensity.
7.2 Microcontroller
Processes LDR sensor signals and controls the speaker output.
7.3 Speaker
Provides audio alerts for passengers upon bus detection.
7.4 Battery
Ensures uninterrupted system operation during power outages.
7.5 Protective Enclosure
Protects internal components from environmental factors such as dust and rain.
8. Working Principle
LDR sensor continuously monitors bus approach.
When the bus is detected, the sensor signals the microcontroller.
The microcontroller activates the speaker alert.
Passengers hear the alert and can safely reach the bus stop.
